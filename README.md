# HTML JS Injector

## How to Use

### Open Chrome Extensions:

Open Google Chrome.
Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter, or click the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner, hover over "`Extensions`", and select "`Manage Extensions`."

### Enable Developer Mode:

On the Extensions page, locate the "`Developer mode`" toggle switch, usually in the top right corner.
Click the toggle to turn on Developer Mode. This will reveal additional options, including "`Load unpacked.`"

### Load the Extension:

Click the "`Load unpacked`" button that appears after enabling Developer Mode.
A file browser window will open. Navigate to the local folder where your extension files are located (this folder should contain your manifest.json file and other extension assets).
Select the folder and click "Select Folder" or "Open."

### Manage and Use the Extension:

If there are no errors in your extension code, it should now be loaded and appear on the `chrome://extensions` page.
You can use the toggle switch to enable or disable the extension.
If your extension has a user interface or functionality that appears in the toolbar, its icon will usually be displayed to the right of the address bar. You can pin it to the toolbar for easier access if desired.
When you restart Chrome, you may see a notification about developer mode extensions. Click "Keep" to keep your local extension enabled.
